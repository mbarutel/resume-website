    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
    <p>
      I am a full-stack software developer with a background in Aviation
      Management and professional leadership experience as a Department Team
      Leader. Driven by my passion for programming, I transitioned into software
      development by graduating from Hive Helsinki, where I gained strong
      foundations in low-level programming and modern software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have dedicated myself to building robust, maintainable, and
      scalable applications. I enjoy creating simple, elegant, modular code and
      continuously improving projects through new ideas and better solutions. I
      thrive on exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, optimizing
      workflows, and collaborating with motivated teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family (especially our
      dog), going on roadtrips, martial arts, and talking about coding projects.
      I am super friendly and have been told by many of previous co-workers that
      they have really enjoyed working with me due to my funny personality and
      fun attitude.
